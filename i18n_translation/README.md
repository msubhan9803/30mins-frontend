# json-deepl-translate

Translate json files with deepl API

Usually multi-language projects developed with a javascript framework (Angular, Vue...) base their
translations on json files with different nesting levels. This small project allows you to generate
new files for other languages while keeping the same structure.

- Works with Python3

```shell
python main.py /path/to/file/en_US.json --locale es --output es_ES.json --indent 4 --sleep 0.5
```

> See more options with `python main.py --help`

## Install

1. Create virtual environment

2. Install dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create an `.env` file with:

```
DEEPL_AUTH_KEY=your-key-here
```

> You can get a free deepl developer account in https://www.deepl.com/pro-checkout/account

## Usage

1. Locate the translation file that you want to use as a source.

```
/home/user/my_project/locales/en_US.json
```

2. Execute the command with the file path and the language you want to generate

```shell
python main.py /home/user/my_project/locales/en_US.json --locale ES --output es_ES.json
```

The script will create an `es_ES.json` file in the same folder as the source file.

- You can check your API usage with

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: DeepL-Auth-Key YOUR-API-KEY-HERE" https://api-free.deepl.com/v2/usage
```

## Tests

Run tests with:
